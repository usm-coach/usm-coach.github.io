This post is first part in a series about building and adopting a state-of-the-art streaming data integration platform.

Larger enterprises often have a complex system-of-systems. Typically there are
modern systems, based on microservice architectures, perhaps running in public
or private cloud. There may be older, probably monolithic systems. Some of them
may still be running on mainframe. There are often commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) products. And so on.

Often we need to use the data from these systems elsewhere. Reporting and analysis are common
needs, and in this case we may employ analytical databases.  More recently, data clouds have 
emerged, such as Snowflake.

Data may be needed in operative applications as well. For example we might
want to show the data to employees, customers, and business partners.  Often we
have different freshness requirements for showing operative data as compared to
reporting or analytical data. Therefore, we probably cannot use the analytical and
reporting datases for operative applications.

Another approach is to use backend systems directly, through APIs. This has the
benefit that the data is fresh, and changes may be easily supported as
well. However, the availability and performance characteristics of backend
systems might not match the requirements of the end user facing applications.

If you need to fetch data from tens of systems just to show the landing page,
your application may take tens of seconds to load, which is probably too much for 
your end users.

If you use data sources directly, you also increase system interdependency. If
you have lots of backend applications, every time you use an interface of
legacy system in a new application, you make it more difficult to replace the
legacy system later.

You may alleviate this issue somewhat by creating an interface layer in front 
of the legacy system, i.e. using the strangler pattern. But unless you put effort 
to design this interface properly, the issue is really not solved: there is just an
intermediate interface that needs to be deprecated later.

Commercial integration platforms, sometimes called Hybrid Integration Platforms (HIP), offer
some help. Integration may also be offered as a service (IPaaS). Many of these platforms 
have evolved from Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) products. They may be very useful in 
various scenarios, such as when you need data from a system that has a existing connector. 
The main selling point of these integration platforms is that they can reduce the 
implementation costs.

Big part of integration costs are typically not the integration implementation
itself, but everything else.  For example getting to know what data you need,
finding which systems contain the data, negotiating the explicit (or implicit)
data model with various parties, specifying data formats etc. What integration
platform vendors might not tell you is that integration platforms will not help
you with the expensive part of building integrations. The promised cost
savings might not materialize.

There are some hidden long-term costs related to integration platforms as well.
The important one is employee satisfaction.  Most senior developers do not
really like integration platforms. They smell like the ESBs that never really
took off.

The reason why senior developers dislike these platforms is that they typically
have their own language for defining mappings between systems and data formats,
with more limited expressive power than full-blown programming languages, such
as Java. Having an additional platform also increases the complexity, by adding
more layers and components. Typically there is a steep performance penalty in using 
integration platforms as well.

Management may like the integration platforms, because their selling point that
integrations need less senior developers. We return back to the fact that 
actually understanding the semantics of the integrated data is the more complex part,
and that cannot be outsourced to junior developers.

The integration platforms typically solve the simple problems related to
integration. With with the more complex problems you are on your own. Examples
of more complex issues are solving persistent error situations when source or target systems 
are down, providing more reliable and performant access to data than source systems can
support, helping with data reconciliation, ensuring data integrity over multiple systems.

We analyzed existing integration platforms, but could not find one that would really 
help us to provide reliable, performant and consistent access to data for operative
applications.
